# Minesweeper Clone JS

## Intro

This is my awful minesweeper clone written in JS. *Technically* you can play and win this, but you can technically do a lot of things that you shouldn't.

I used the `p5.js` library through a CDN so no extra downloads are required if you chose to run it.

## Plans

* Make is so that cells with no surrounding bombs auto open the cells surrounding it.
* Implement user control over how many bombs / size of grid.
* Add a minesweeper solving algorithm so that no board is unsolvable.
* Generate the mines in a better way, i.e. around the users first click.
